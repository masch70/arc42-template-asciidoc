arc42-template-asciidoc
=======================

Asciidoc version of the unbeatable Arc42-Template originally created by Gernot Starke and Peter Hruschka.

To generate final documents of this template, you'll need the [asciidoc tools](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/index.html).

Some sample calls can be found in the doit.sh shell script which should provide a jump start for further refinements of the outputs.

I assume that for those of you who are interested in this template, plain text writing is a key driver and [Vim](http://vim.org/)
is one of your favourite tools. I recommend using the [asciidoc-vim](https://github.com/dagwieers/asciidoc-vim) and
[Control-P](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) plugins/syntax files which make working with the asciidoc files a breeze...
